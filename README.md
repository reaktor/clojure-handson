If you want to participate in the Introduction to Clojure hands-on session, you'll need a laptop with Light Table editor installed for doing the exercises.  Editor is downloadable from http://lighttable.com.  Once you have the software installed, you need to run in once in order for it to download the clojure development environment.  To do this follow these simple steps:

1. Start the application
2. Press CTRL+space once you have the application running
3. Type "instarepl" and press enter.  You should see a new tab with a title "Instarepl" next to the Welcome tab.
4. Type (+ 1 2) and wait until you see the result being printed next to the command.

Congratulations, you are ready for some serious Clojure hands on -action!
